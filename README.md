# Personal PyTorch Documentation

## Overview

This repository serves as a personal reference for tracking and documenting PyTorch files and functions that I use while learning PyTorch. It is intended as a structured and searchable resource for future reference.

## Python Version

This repository uses Python 3.9.

## Resources

[PyTorch Official Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)

## Contributions

This repository is primarily for personal reference, but a lot of the starter materials were taken from the [YouTube Pytorch Tutorial](https://github.com/patrickloeber/pytorchTutorial).
